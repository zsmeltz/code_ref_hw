This page was originally dull; a basic website that didnt have much to offer. Now it contains some cool tricks I've learned so far in dealing with html and CSS. 
Here you will find that the paragraphs in the webpage now buldge out with a shadow to look like it's coming off the page. Since we learned "positions" in CSS, I made the nav bar a fixed box that will follow you down the page.
